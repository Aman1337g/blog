# Your Friendly Neighbourhood ðŸ¦¸

Welcome to my website. Iâ€™m Aman Kumar Gupta, a final student at IIIT Bhubaneswar.  

Here I share thoughts and learnings about technical topics such as, Kubernetes, 
Cloud Native technologies, DevOps and Linux. I'm also very
interested in anything that increases my productivity, so you will also find
writings on Zettelkasten, (Neo)vim, study techniques and anything that has to do
with taking notes.
